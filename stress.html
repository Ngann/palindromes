<!-- Include several questions.
One that lists warning signs of being negatively affected by stress ("Loss of sleep", "Feeling overwhelmed", etc.)
One that lists health symptoms linked to high-stress ("High blood pressure", "anxiety", etc.)
Another that lists recommended coping methods to deal with stress. ("Meditate", "Manage your time", "Pet a cat", etc.) Instruct users to check all that apply to them.
Then, based on user answers, provide some guidance: For instance, if a user reports 4 stress-related symptoms, and 6 warning signs apply to them, suggest some resources to help them out.
Or, if a user says 4 warning signs of high stress apply to them, but they also report using 5 of the recommended ways to manage stress, tell them they're doing a pretty good job.
Include at least 3 possible results. -->
